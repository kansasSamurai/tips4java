The Color class in Java uses Red, Green and Blue (RGB) values to specify a Color.
 I don't know about you, but I have no idea how to manipulate a given Color to return a related Color.
 For example, how would you go about returning a "darker" or "lighter" color.
 Sure the Color API supports brighter() and darker() methods,
 but they don't seem to work that well and you can't control the degree of brightness or darkness.
 The API also supports a HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color space which seemed promising,
 but didn't	quite return the results I was looking for.

So, I searched the web and found out about the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance) color space
 which is far easier for me to understand.
 - "hue" represents the color (think colors of the rainbow).
 Its value is specified in degrees. Red is 0, green is 120 and blue is 240.
 - "saturation" represents the purity of the color.
 Its value is specified as a percentage.
 100 percent is fully saturated and 0 percent is gray.
 - "luminance" represents the brighness of the color.
 Its value is specified as a percent.
 100 percent is white and 0 percent is black.

As a result of this searching I ended up creating the HSLColor class.
 This class provides methods that enable easy manipulation of the HSL values
 to return a Color object that can be used by Java Components.
 The easiest way to create a HSLColor object is to provide it with a Color object.
 You would then create new Color objects by using the following methods:

 - adjustHue - specify an(float degrees)
 - adjustLuminance - specify an absolute percentage of luminance
 - adjustSaturation - specify an absolute percentage of saturation
 - adjustShade - adjusting the shade will give you a darker color.
 You control how much darker the color is by specifying the adjustmnt percent.
 - adjustTone - adjusting the tone will give you a lighter color.
 You control how much lighter the color is by specifying the adjustment percent.
 - getComplimentary - a complementary Color differs from its color by 180 degrees.

The HSLColor class might come in handy when you want to use a color theme for your component.
 Maybe you want to have a light background and dark foreground (or vice versa).
 So instead of just using white and black you can use different shades and tones of a specific color.
 Something like:

HSLColor base = new HSLColor( Color.RED );
component.setBackground( base.adjustTone(20) );
component.setForeground( base.adjustShade(20) );

Now, whatever base color you choose the background with be 20% lighter and the foreground 20% darker.

The webstart demo is not intended to be a color chooser.
 It is provided to give you an example of how the colors change as you adjust the different HSL values.
 Hopefully this will make it easier for you to decide on a color theme.
