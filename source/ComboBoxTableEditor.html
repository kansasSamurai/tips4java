When using a JComboBox as an editor in a column of a JTable
 the same combo box is used for all rows in the column.
 There may be times when you want different rows to use a different combo box.
<!--more-->

Two approaches I've seen to solve this problem would be:

- override the getCellEditor() method of JTable to return the appropriate editor.
 The row and column are passed as parameters to this method
 so you would use those values (along with any other table data, if necessary) to determine which editor to use.

- create a custom TableCellEditor and override the getTableCellEditorComponent() method to return the appropriate editor.
 Again, the row, column and all table data is available to help in determining which editor to use.

Theoretically you could have a different editor for every row in the table using either of the above approaches.
 However my proposed solution, which is based on using a custom editor,
 will assume that the choice of the editor to be used is based on some other data in the table.
 That is, the value from another column in the same row will be used to determine the editor.
 As a simple example you could have two related columns like "Month" and "Day".
 The editor to be used to select a "Day" can only be determined once the "Month" has been selected.

The ComboBoxTableEditor is a custom editor that uses a single combo box as the editor
 but it allows you to specify different ComboBoxModels for different values in the related column.
 Using the ComboboxTableEditor is straight forward.
 First, you need to specify the related column, which is done when the ComboBoxTableEditor is created.
 Secondly, you need to map possible values from this column to a specific ComboBoxModel.
 This is done by using the addModel() method.

From the image above you can see that the first column contains 3 values: "Color, Fruit, Shape".
 To create the custom editor for the second column we will need to create 3 separate models, one for each value.
 The code would be something like:


ComboBoxTableEditor editor = new ComboBoxTableEditor(0);
table.getColumnModel().getColumn(1).setCellEditor( editor );

String[] items1 = { "Red", "Blue", "Green" };
editor.addModel("Color", items1);

String[] items2 = { "Circle", "Square", "Triangle" };
editor.addModel("Shape", items2);

String[] items3 = { "Apple", "Orange", "Banana" };
editor.addModel("Fruit", items3);

As the values of the first column are dynamically changed,
 the model used by the combo box editor in the second column will also be changed.

Note, the Webstart demo uses code from the "Table Cell Listener" and "Combo Box Prompt" entries.
